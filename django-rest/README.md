# Django

## Purposal
We'll use Django to build backend server. The reasons are:
- We need to use python to integrate with ML stack
- We don't want to build a user management system by ourself. Django has a good community support
- Authencitation is done by token, so that it could be used by both web and mobile.
- We won't use django's template, because it is difficult to use. We'll make Django a backend only server

## Issues
- User management support
- Access token
