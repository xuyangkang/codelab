# Codelab

Personally, I'd like to use this tech stack for full stack engineering:

- Frontend
  - Typescript + React
  - Parcel
  - Express to serve static files built by parcel
- Mobile
  - Flutter
- Backend
  - Django Rest

This repository is a collection of minimal demos, to test feasibility and provide solutions for issues.
